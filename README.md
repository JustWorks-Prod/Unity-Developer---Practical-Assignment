Practical Task – Unity / C# Developer


Unity version: 2020.3.25f1

~~•	Please create 3D Test Project and implement the game.~~

~~•	The main player is Cylinder, which collects other models in the play zone.~~

~~•	The Cube can move by A, W, S, and D keys.~~

~~•	Your play zone is a square surface.~~

~~•	The game starts with a 0 score. When Cylinder pushes other game objects - the score increases, depending on the game object and level, and the object disappears from the game.~~

~~•	The new game objects appear randomly in the play zone after Cylinder pushed another game object.~~

~~•	From time to time in the game appear Cube which Cylinder can't move them, the player should bypass it.~~

•	If player pushes the same type of game object one by one the score decreases on double value.

    o	Instructions are unclear.

~~•	The player moves to the next level when you achieve 100 points.~~

~~•	The player finishes the game in two cases: winner - achieves 400 points, loser - you are blocked by Cubes and can't move to any other square.~~

    o	The win and lose conditions are specified on-screen, as it is unclear as to how these conditions should be expressed.

~~•	Please scale the Cylinder and appearance depending on the game Level. Results of the game (Time of attempt, Score, amount of pushed objects) save as a JSON file to the file system.~~

    o	Save data is not yet implemented

~~•	Score:
            Level 1     Level 2     Level 3
Sphere      1           10          20
Capsule     2           12          22~~

    o	Again, unclear as to what these values are to mean/how to express them in the game; expressed them to the best of my understanding.

•	To review the game, please upload your solution to Github and send the link.
